Introduction: -
In the dynamic world of advertising, data and information are the lifeblood of success. Advertising agencies are tasked with creating, managing, 
and optimizing advertising campaigns on behalf of their clients, often involving complex interactions between clients, campaigns, advertisements, 
and employees. To streamline these operations and enhance the overall efficiency, accuracy, and effectiveness of the agency's workflow, 
the development of a robust Database Management System (DBMS) is imperative.

This project aims to create a tailor-made DBMS specifically designed to meet the unique needs of an advertising agency. 
The system will encompass the entire spectrum of agency operations, providing a centralized and organized platform for managing client data, 
campaign details, advertisement materials, and employee information.

The DBMS for the advertising agency will not only serve as a repository for critical data but will also facilitate data retrieval, 
reporting, and analytics, enabling the agency to make informed decisions, measure campaign performance,
and provide exceptional service to its clients.
